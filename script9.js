/*
"falsy" values in JS:

0 -0 NaN
""
false
null
undefined


The easiest ways to check if sth is going to become truthy or falsy:
memorize this list and then consult it.

Either it's on the above list, or the only other possible option is
that it must be truthy.

void is an operator that everything that you give it after it, becomes undefined.

e.g. void 42, void 0, try it in the console
